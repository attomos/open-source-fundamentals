Well, it all started in the 90’s by software communities, “*open source*” means you can modify something because its design is publicly accessible.

Yeah, when we hear “open source” we think about computer software development right away, today the term “open source” designates a set of values that we call [the open source way](https://opensource.com/open-source-way). Open source projects, products, or initiatives are those that embrace and celebrate open exchange, collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community development.

### What is open source software?

Simple, open source software is software whose source code is available for modification or enhancement by **anyone**.

“*Source code*” is the beautiful code we write that most computer users don’t ever see, I know, it’s sad but it’s true. This code is also what programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software or application works. Programmers who have access to a computer program’s source code can improve that program by adding features or fixing parts that don’t always work correctly.

Even though open source software is mostly developed and maintained by a group of people, anyone can access the code and play around with it if they want to.
